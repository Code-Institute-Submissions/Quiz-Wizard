# Website planning

## Strategy
**What am I creating?**

A web app for a trivia game

**What do we want to do?**

Display trivia questions and answer selection, store and display results

**What do we want?**

A functional app the accurately displays and updates information, and displays results. Promotes ease of use. Intuitive and easy to navigate.

**What does a user want when using a trivia game app?**

* To easily choose the category for questions
* To set the difficulty to their preference
* An educational form of entertainment
* Immediate feedback after each question

#### User stories

* I love pub quiz night, but at the moment I can't attend the weekly event due to isolation. I'd like to keep up on my trivia knowledge so that I can be on top when quiz night resumes.
* As an avid game show fan, I want to participate in a similar experience so that I can feel like I'm a part of the show. Maybe one day I'll feel confident enough to go on one!
* I teach children in the early teens, and I'm looking for something fun and interesting to do when they have finished all their assignments. I want to be able to challenge them with general knowledge, but not questions that are too difficult.
* Since I retired I have a lot of spare time, I like to keep my mind sharp by exercising it with challenging activities such as trivia.
* Sometimes my partner and I like to challenge each other with random trivia facts. I'd like to be able to access a wide range of questions so that I can easily shoot them off at a moments notice.

## Scope

**Single page web app**

* nav bar/header
* how to use/instructions
* bg image
* category selection
* display questions and update
* display score
* reset button

### Functional Requirements

* The site will be public and available to anyone
* Users are able to interact with the game
* Stores and displays updated and relevent data

### Content Requirements

* Header with logo, game name and menu
* Display content of the game - category, question, answer choices, result and score
* Footer/contact information

## Structure

### Interaction design

* Navigation at top. Due to the nature of the project being a single page, navigation will be limited to instructions and resetting the game
* Clicking the logo also resets the game - possibly with a confirmation required so user doesn't lose progress
* Could have an initial welcome screen that fades or requires a button click to begin, rather than opening on a category select screen
